With this project, I initially aimed to create a song lyrics generator, where
you could search up your favourite songs and a pos-tagger would find and replace
words based on their word-type with Star Wars references using the SWAPI (Star Wars API). However, I wasn't able to make any natural language processors work
with my code and after much time, I instead decided to create a Star Wars Themed Karaoke reader that fetches lyrics of a song you search and displays them in a scrolling format using WEBGL in the style of the film's intro, with a background that is responsive to the amplitude of the music.
