# Star Wars Karaoke 

Take JSON response from a lyrics API and displays it in a star wars introduction style format.

Project site: <http://projects.ryanweston.me/star-wars-karaoke>

**Disclaimer:** Project was developed for a short, first year university module. It is by no means clean, and the WebGL is really buggy and inefficient. I'll be looking to clean the project up in the near future.

### Roadmap
----
- 📁 **Clean up file structure.**
- 🎵 Look for a way to include the Spotify API to play the searched song alongside the lyrics.
- 🌟 Improve the WebGL stars and map their speed to the song, acting as an audio visualiser.
- 🎨 Fix CSS bugs.
- 📱 Improve mobile responsiveness.
